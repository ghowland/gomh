## sysync

sysync is a system configuration manager, like Puppet or Chef, but is declarative and deterministic.

This tool has 1.5+ years of managing a medium sized production system, but the deployment mechanism was scripted just for that environment.  I'll be working on making the deployment something that can be installed into any environment soon.

So consider this not-yet-ready for your environment yet.  Also, no docs yet.  I have to write those up too.

Also, I need to finish creating an exmaple conf system that demonstrates all the features without being too specific about the environment it was managing previously.
