## gomh - Get Off My Head

A simple game made in PyGame to illustrate programming principles as the feature complexity increases.

Basic gameplay is using the arrow keys to move right/left, and up to jump.  Standing on another character's head will drain their life and eventually reset them.  If a character lands on your head, you can jump to bounce them off.

Inside the ./backups/ directory is a series of files named "gomh_000.py" and increasing in number.  These are earlier versions of this code, which started from just displaying a static image on the screen, and later added input, and actors, and controls and AI.

The progression follows from the most basic kind of "straight down" procedural programming with naive variable names, and then adds in containers, functions and classes/objects later as the program becomes unwieldy.

In this way, the reader can see how a program can evolve (and how the methods of programming historically evolved) from being simple and naive, to dealing with scaling problems with more encapsulation and abstraction.
